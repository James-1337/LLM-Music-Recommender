## Recorded Results

### Experiment Descriptions

| Experiment | Data | Purpose | Semantic source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Full non-semantic enhanced baseline | `spotify_playlist_50percent_50item.csv`, full run | Main CF + metadata benchmark | None | Best historical result on strict 50+ songs and 50%+ lyrics coverage. In this README, "baseline" means CF only; artist score and popularity are metadata enhancement. |
| Full non-semantic broader data | `spotify_playlist_50item.csv`, full run | Check performance when only playlist length is constrained | None | Lower quality because many playlists have weaker lyric coverage. |
| Fine playlist semantic, 179 playlists | `spotify_playlist_50percent_50item.csv`, first 180 loaded, 179 eval | Test fine controlled playlist semantic schema | Qwen playlist profiles only | Diagnostic run; playlist semantic alone was weak. |
| Playlist-song semantic, 179 playlists | Same 179 eval playlists | Compare playlist tags to song-side tags | Qwen playlist profiles + heuristic song profiles | Small improvement at `semantic_weight=0.01`, but not the final long-run result. |
| Long playlist-song semantic run | `spotify_playlist_50percent_50item.csv`, first 800 loaded, 799 eval | Main two-hour semantic comparison | Qwen playlist profiles + heuristic song profiles | Actual long run took about 104 minutes. |
| Artist-diverse semantic run | `spotify_playlist_50percent_50item_artist_diverse.csv`, 262 eval | Test the same algorithm on playlists where no artist dominates | Qwen playlist profiles + heuristic song profiles | This subset is harder for artist-based CF. |
| Pre-song-profile semantic comparison | Same 799 eval playlists | Compare old direct playlist semantic scoring to new playlist-song semantic scoring | Qwen playlist profiles | Old method matched playlist tags directly against raw title/artist/lyrics text. |
| Semantic as Stage 1 retrieval | Same 799 eval playlists | Test whether semantic can replace CF candidate retrieval | Qwen playlist profiles + heuristic song profiles | Result: semantic should not replace CF in Stage 1. |
| Artist-diverse playlist split | `spotify_playlist_50percent_50item.csv`, all playlists | Separate playlists whose top artist share is low | None | Fast CSV split; no LLM, no CF, no GPU needed. |
| LEMON smoke prototype | `playlist_50%_50c_799.csv`, first 50 eval playlists | Test a LEMON-like emotion-vector architecture | Heuristic song emotion vectors | Standalone `lemon.py`; not the full trained LEMON model. |
| LEMON+KAR full Qwen song run | `playlist_50%_50c_799.csv`, 799 eval playlists | Compare CF baseline, KAR-only, CF+KAR, and metadata-enhanced variants | 8,756 Qwen song profiles | Full overnight run; Qwen generation took about 11.27 hours; cached rerun took about 71 seconds. |
| LEMON+KAR neural adapter | `playlist_50%_50c_799.csv`, 799 eval playlists | Train learned recommender alignment on 80% playlists and test on train/test/all splits | 8,756 cached Qwen song profiles | Pairwise neural reranker over CF, metadata, LEMON, KAR, and KAR-vector interaction features. |

### Stage 1

Stage 1 measures candidate recall before final top-10 ranking. NDCG and Proxy do
not apply to this candidate-retrieval table.

### Stage 1 Only

This experiment treats semantic retrieval itself as Stage 1 candidate generation
and disables forced artist quotas. It tests whether semantic retrieval can
replace original co-occurrence CF before metadata reranking.

### Main Conclusions

| Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Best overall result remains the non-semantic historical metadata-enhanced run. | `CF + artist75% + artist score + popularity`: Recall@10 `0.40962`, NDCG@10 `0.41844`, Proxy@10 `0.41403`. |
| In the 799-playlist long run, CF only is the baseline and metadata enhancement is still best. | Baseline CF-only Proxy@10 is `0.38841`; enhanced baseline Proxy@10 is `0.40708`. |
| New playlist-song semantic reranking reduces damage compared with old direct playlist-to-lyrics semantic matching. | Old direct semantic combined Proxy@10 `0.39842`; new playlist-song combined Proxy@10 `0.40356`; enhanced non-semantic baseline `0.40708`. |
| The 262 artist-diverse subset is much harder than the 799 mixed subset. | Best diverse Proxy@10 is about `0.10188` for CF + artist75% + popularity, versus `0.40708` on the 799 mixed subset. |
| Playlist-song semantic does not improve the artist-diverse subset. | Diverse CF + artist25% + artist score + popularity Proxy@10 is `0.10062`; adding playlist-song semantic gives `0.09997`. |
| LEMON smoke currently behaves like a noisy weak semantic feature. | On 50 eval playlists, CF + artist + popularity Proxy@10 is `0.27694`; adding LEMON at weight `0.01` gives `0.27391`. |
| Learned SVD embeddings run, but do not solve the weak semantic input problem. | SVD explained `0.660` variance from 72 semantic features, but CF + LEMON SVD Proxy@10 is `0.27542`, still below the 50-playlist enhanced baseline `0.27694`. |
| Partial Qwen song semantics looked promising, but the full run gives a more nuanced result. | On 799 playlists, CF+KAR improves over CF-only baseline from Proxy@10 `0.38841` to `0.39062`, but enhanced baseline+KAR is `0.40683`, slightly below enhanced baseline `0.40708`. |
| KAR encoding is stronger than LEMON-only in smoke tests. | On 50 playlists with heuristic song semantic, LEMON+KAR-only Proxy@10 is `0.05522` versus LEMON-only `0.03665`; on 5 playlists with Qwen partial song semantic, Baseline+KAR reaches `0.38932`. |
| Full Qwen KAR is useful as a semantic signal. | On 799 playlists, KAR-only Proxy@10 is `0.14513`, much stronger than LEMON-only `0.03410`; CF+KAR improves over CF-only, but metadata-enhanced fusion still does not beat metadata-enhanced baseline. |
| Learned neural alignment can improve the all-799 score, but test generalization is not yet stronger than the enhanced baseline. | Pairwise neural adapter reaches all-799 Proxy@10 `0.41043`, above enhanced baseline `0.40708`; on the held-out 20% playlists, adapter Proxy@10 is `0.40521`, below enhanced baseline `0.41255`. |
| Adapter ablation shows the main learned gain is from CF+metadata, not KAR. | On the held-out 20% split, `Adapter CF + metadata` reaches Proxy@10 `0.43165`; adding LEMON gives `0.43330`, while adding KAR score gives `0.42080` and KAR vector gives `0.41166`. |
| Semantic-only retrieval is weak. | Stage 1 Recall@500 is `0.09136` for direct playlist semantic and `0.07472` for playlist-song semantic, versus `0.80889` for original CF. |
| Semantic should stay in Stage 2 as a low-weight reranking signal, not replace Stage 1 CF. | Semantic Stage 1 retrieval collapses both candidate recall and final top-10 quality. |
| Deprecated favorite-artist semantic improved scores but was not a clean semantic result. | It mainly behaved like artist metadata / artist-CF, so it was removed from the active semantic schema. |

### Semantic Diagnosis And Paper Alignment

The three papers do not imply that simple playlist tags should beat a strong CF
baseline by themselves.

| Paper | What the paper does | Relation to current result |
|---|---|---|
| `paper/2024.findings-naacl.39.pdf` | LLM-REC enriches item text with multiple prompting strategies, then feeds augmented text into a recommendation model. It also reports that important keywords help more than arbitrary extra text. | Our current semantic path uses a small controlled JSON tag set and tag overlap, not learned text embeddings over enriched item descriptions. Weak semantic-only scores are therefore expected. |
| `paper/Enhanced Emotion-aware Music Recommendation via Large Language Models.pdf` | LEMON extracts multi-faceted emotion semantics from song content, builds emotion-enhanced content embeddings, models short-term and long-term user emotion sequences, then uses adaptive fusion. | Our current system has Qwen playlist tags, but song-side tags are heuristic and there is no trained dual-temporal user emotion encoder or adaptive fusion. |
| `paper/Towards Open-World Recommendation with Knowledge Augmentation from Large Language Models.pdf` | KAR generates factual and preference reasoning knowledge, encodes it, adapts it through a hybrid-expert adapter, then plugs augmented vectors into recommender models. It also notes that directly using LLMs as recommenders generally falls behind SOTA algorithms. | Our result matches this warning: direct semantic-only ranking is weak. The paper direction is LLM-as-knowledge-component, not LLM-as-final-ranker. |

Current semantic input:

```text
For each evaluation playlist:
1. Split playlist into observed songs and heldout songs.
2. Send only observed songs to Qwen.
3. Use only the most recent 8 observed songs in the prompt.
4. For each prompted song, include title, artist, and the first 100 lyric characters.
5. Do not include heldout songs.
```

Current playlist semantic output schema:

```json
{
  "top_keywords": [],
  "affect": [],
  "energy": "",
  "valence": "",
  "genre_style": [],
  "narrative_theme": [],
  "listening_context": "",
  "cohesion": "",
  "next_song_role": ""
}
```

Current song semantic side:

```text
Song profiles are not generated by LLM.
They are heuristic labels from title + lyrics keyword hits.
Stage 2 compares playlist profile and song profile by weighted tag overlap.
Default semantic_weight = 0.01.
```

Good semantic example:

| Playlist | Observed examples | Qwen output | Why it is good |
|---|---|---|---|
| `563051` | Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Norah Jones | `genre_style=["folk","pop"]`, `affect=["melancholic","uplifting"]`, `energy="mid"`, `valence="positive"` | This matches a soft singer-songwriter / folk-pop playlist. Heldout songs are John Denver and Kenny Loggins, so the semantic direction is plausible even if it cannot identify exact artists. |

Bad semantic example:

| Playlist | Observed examples | Qwen output | Problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| `4745` | Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots, Rage Against The Machine, Nirvana, Green Day, Soundgarden | `genre_style=["pop","indie"]`, `energy="low"`, `affect=["melancholic","romantic"]` | This is clearly an alt-rock / grunge / punk-rock playlist. The output misses rock intensity and therefore pushes candidate matching toward the wrong semantic neighborhood. |

Main diagnosis:

```text
The current semantic feature is a coarse descriptor, not a learned recommender
representation. It can summarize some playlist vibes, but it does not encode
artist continuity, release-era continuity, subgenre neighborhoods, or user-level
sequence preference strongly enough to beat CF.
```

KAR-style vectors versus "LLM text then CF":

```text
CF matrix:
  Learns item-item or user-item relations from co-occurrence.
  Text is not used unless it is encoded into features and fused into the model.

LLM text/tag overlap:
  Generates labels or text, then applies hand-written matching.
  This creates a semantic score, but it is not trained to align with the target
  recommendation metric.

KAR-style vector augmentation:
  Generates factual/preference knowledge, encodes it into dense vectors, adapts
  those vectors through trainable modules, then uses them inside the recommender.
  The important part is not merely "there is a matrix"; it is that the matrix is
  aligned with the recommendation objective.
```

### LEMON Smoke Prototype

`lemon.py` is a standalone LEMON-inspired structure, not a full reproduction.

| LEMON paper component | `lemon.py` smoke implementation |
|---|---|
| LLM-driven emotion extraction | Loads cached song semantic CSV or falls back to title/lyrics keyword emotion labels. |
| Emotion-enhanced content embedding lookup | Converts each song semantic profile into a weighted normalized vector. |
| Long-term user emotion representation | Averages emotion vectors over all observed songs. |
| Short-term user emotion representation | Averages emotion vectors over the most recent observed songs. |
| Adaptive fusion coefficient | Computes short/long agreement and increases short-term weight when they drift. |
| Recommendation utilization | Reranks the existing Stage 1 CF candidate pool with a LEMON vector similarity feature. |

Smoke input:

```text
playlist_csv = dataFiltered/playlist_50%_50c_799.csv
song_semantic_csv = dataFiltered/song_semantics_fine_keywords_800_heuristic.csv
eval playlists = 50
eval songs = 2,303
adaptive alpha avg/min/max = 0.391 / 0.367 / 0.437
```

Smoke result:

```text
LEMON-only Proxy@10                         = 0.03665
CF + artist + popularity Proxy@10           = 0.27694
CF + artist + popularity + LEMON Proxy@10   = 0.27391  (lemon_weight = 0.01)
```

Learned embedding smoke:

```text
embedding_mode = svd
SVD dim = 16
feature count = 72
explained variance = 0.660

LEMON SVD-only Proxy@10                      = 0.02815
CF + artist + popularity + LEMON SVD Proxy   = 0.27542  (lemon_weight = 0.01)
```

Qwen song-semantic partial smoke:

```text
playlist_csv = dataFiltered/playlist_50%_50c_799.csv
eval playlists = 5
eval songs = 306
Qwen generated song profiles = 40
heuristic fallback profiles = 266
missing/no-data songs = 0
generation time = about 389 seconds

LEMON Qwen-song only Proxy@10                 = 0.01948
CF + artist + popularity Proxy@10             = 0.24620
CF + artist + popularity + LEMON Qwen Proxy   = 0.33067  (lemon_weight = 0.01)
```

Example Qwen song semantic output:

```json
{
  "song_id": "adele::hello",
  "title": "Hello",
  "artist": "Adele",
  "semantic": {
    "affect": ["melancholic", "angsty"],
    "cohesion": "theme",
    "energy": "mid",
    "genre_style": ["pop", "soul"],
    "listening_context": "mixed",
    "narrative_theme": ["love", "heartbreak"],
    "next_song_role": "cooldown",
    "top_keywords": ["romantic_tension", "heartbreak", "mixed"],
    "valence": "negative"
  }
}
```

Interpretation:

```text
The structure is closer to the LEMON paper than the playlist JSON-tag method,
but the current song emotion vectors are still heuristic and not learned.
Before running 800 playlists, the next useful improvement is better song-side
emotion extraction or learned/embedding-based vectors, not only a larger run.
```

Heuristic versus learned embedding:

```text
Heuristic embedding:
  A human writes rules and weights, e.g. affect:melancholic = 2.2,
  genre_style:rock = 1.2. The model does not learn whether those weights help
  Recall@10 or NDCG@10.

Learned embedding:
  Build a feature matrix from songs, then use data to learn a lower-dimensional
  representation. lemon.py currently supports --embedding-mode svd, which learns
  latent dimensions from the song semantic feature matrix. This is still
  unsupervised; a full LEMON-style model would train embeddings or fusion weights
  against recommendation labels.
```

### LEMON + KAR Smoke Prototype

`lemonKAR.py` adds a KAR-style encoder on top of the LEMON smoke structure.

| KAR paper component | `lemonKAR.py` smoke implementation |
|---|---|
| Item factual knowledge | Text built from song title, artist, semantic labels, and lyric excerpt. |
| User preference reasoning knowledge | Text built from recent observed songs, frequent artists, long-term semantic labels, and short-term semantic labels. |
| Knowledge encoder | TF-IDF over item/user knowledge text followed by TruncatedSVD. |
| Knowledge adaptation | Lightweight normalized vector scoring; no trainable hybrid-expert adapter yet. |
| Knowledge utilization | KAR score can rank alone, be fused with CF-only baseline, or be fused with metadata-enhanced baseline. |

Heuristic-song 50-playlist smoke:

```text
KAR encoder = TF-IDF + TruncatedSVD
KAR dim = 32
KAR vocabulary = 4,000
KAR explained variance = 0.228

Enhanced baseline Proxy@10     = 0.27694
LEMON only Proxy@10            = 0.03665

LEMON + KAR only Proxy@10      = 0.05522
Enhanced baseline + KAR Proxy  = 0.27546
Enhanced baseline + LEMON + KAR Proxy = 0.27589
```

Qwen partial 5-playlist smoke:

```text

Adapter CF + metadata + LEMON + KAR all Proxy@10 = 0.41337
```

Interpretation:

```text
KAR-style encoding gives a clearer signal than LEMON emotion vectors alone.
With heuristic song semantics, it still does not beat the metadata-enhanced
baseline after fusion. The partial Qwen 5-playlist smoke looked much better, but
the full 799-playlist run shows the gain is smaller: KAR-only is a real semantic
signal, CF+KAR beats CF-only, and enhanced baseline+KAR still lands just below
the enhanced baseline. The learned neural adapter improves the requested all-799
evaluation, but it does not yet beat the enhanced baseline on the clean held-out
20% split, so it should be reported as promising but not fully generalized.

The ablation changes the story: the best learned adapter is not the full
LEMON+KAR adapter. The strongest held-out result is CF + metadata + LEMON, and
the strongest all-799 result is CF + metadata. That means most of the neural
adapter gain comes from learning a better nonlinear alignment of CF, artist, and
popularity features. Current KAR features still provide semantic signal, but in
this adapter setup they do not improve over the learned metadata adapter.
```

### Artist Diversity Split

This split uses the teammate rule added to the current code:

| Data | Rule | Total playlists | Diverse playlists | Diverse rows | Output |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `spotify_playlist_50percent_50item.csv` | top artist share `<= 0.40`, at least `5` unique artists, at least `20` deduped tracks | 1,041 | 262 | 19,454 | `dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50percent_50item_artist_diverse.csv` |

The summary table for every playlist is:

```text
dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50percent_50item_artist_diversity_summary.csv
```

## Direction

The default project path remains a non-LLM playlist continuation prototype.
Playlist-side LLM semantics are now available as an optional experiment.

```text
Input:  earlier songs in a playlist
Target: final 10 songs of that playlist
Output: top-10 recommended songs
Metrics: Recall@10 and NDCG@10
```

The default system uses original playlist/song metadata and playlist co-occurrence:

```text
Stage 1: same-artist candidate retrieval + CF + popularity
Stage 2: CF + artist metadata + popularity
```

The optional semantic path generates one controlled semantic profile per
evaluation playlist from the observed songs only, caches the JSONL output, builds
song-side semantic profiles for candidate songs, and adds a playlist-song
semantic-match feature to Stage 2 reranking. It does not use heldout songs when
producing playlist semantics.

```

## Data

Required lyrics catalog:

```text
data/spotify_millsongdata.csv
```

Spotify Million Playlist Dataset slices should live directly in `data/`:

```text
data/mpd.slice.0-999.json
data/mpd.slice.1000-1999.json
...
```

Download playlist data once:

```cmd
pushd <project-folder>
python .\download_data.py --playlists
```

Mark playlist coverage once:

```cmd
pushd <project-folder>
python .\playlistMarker.py --workers 4
```

Extract filtered playlist CSVs:

```cmd
pushd <project-folder>
python .\playlistFilter.py
```

Current filtered outputs:

```text
dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50percent_50item.csv
dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50item.csv
dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50percent.csv
dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50percent_50item_artist_diverse.csv
dataFiltered/spotify_playlist_50percent_50item_artist_diversity_summary.csv
```

Current short aliases:

```text
dataFiltered/playlist_50%_50c.csv
dataFiltered/playlist_50%_50c_799.csv
dataFiltered/playlist_50%_50c_diverse262.csv
dataFiltered/playlist_50%_50c_diverse262_summary.csv
dataFiltered/playlist_50%.csv
dataFiltered/playlist_50c.csv
dataFiltered/playlist_semantics_fine_keywords_800_qwen.csv
dataFiltered/song_semantics_fine_keywords_800_heuristic.csv
dataFiltered/song_semantics_fine_keywords_qwen.csv
dataFiltered/song_semantics_fine_keywords_qwen.jsonl
```

CSV versus JSONL:

```text
CSV is easier to inspect, diff, and join with playlist CSVs.
JSONL is better for append-only semantic caches with nested arrays.
For the current 2-5 MB semantic files, speed difference is not important.
Both CSV-vs-CSV and JSONL-vs-CSV are fine as long as the loader parses the
schema explicitly instead of using string hacks.
```

Git ignore policy:

```text
Track prepared CSV data in dataFiltered/.
Track CSV song data in data/.
Continue ignoring raw MPD JSON, dataMarked/, models/, logs/, and pycache.
```

## Metadata Used

Song metadata used by the recommender:

```text
song_id, title, artist, lyrics, popularity, cf_neighbors
```

Playlist metadata available in filtered CSVs:

```text
playlist_id, playlist_name, original_track_count, matched_song_count,
matched_coverage_percent, pos, track_name, artist_name
```

Optional playlist semantic metadata:

```text
top_keywords, affect, energy, valence, genre_style, narrative_theme,
listening_context, cohesion, next_song_role
```

Language is not modeled or printed because the joined lyric catalog is effectively English-only.

## Validation

Use playlist-order last-10 holdout:

```text
heldout  = playlist[-min(10, len(playlist)-1):]
observed = all songs before heldout
```

Rules:

```text
recommendations exclude observed songs
truth = heldout songs, up to 10
top K = 10
candidate pools are fixed at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500
default min playlist length = 20
```

The ranking step uses the largest listed Stage 1 pool, 500 candidate songs, before choosing the final top 10.

Metrics:

```text
Stage 1: Recall@100, Recall@200, ..., Recall@500
Stage 2: Recall@10, NDCG@10, Proxy@10
Proxy@10 = (Recall@10 + NDCG@10) / 2
```

## Algorithm

Stage 1 retrieves broad candidates and is optimized for recall:

```text
1. Build song-song collaborative filtering neighbors from playlist co-occurrence.
2. Score candidates from observed songs using the CF neighbor graph.
3. Add same-artist forced candidates using recent observed artists first.
4. Fill remaining candidate slots with popularity.
5. Evaluate same-artist quotas at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.
6. Report candidate recall at R@100, R@200, R@300, R@400, and R@500.
```

Stage 2 ranks Stage 1 candidates:

```text
final_score =
  cf_weight     * cf_score_norm
+ artist_weight * same_artist_score_norm
+ pop_weight    * popularity_norm
+ semantic_weight * playlist_song_semantic_score_norm   # only when --playlist-semantics is enabled
```

Default weights:

```text
cf_weight     = 0.35
artist_weight = 0.10
pop_weight    = 0.10
semantic_weight = 0.01
```

The semantic feature is optional. When enabled, the recommender generates or
loads one playlist profile from observed songs only. It also builds song-side
semantic profiles for the evaluation catalog, then scores candidates by comparing
playlist tags against candidate-song tags in the same schema.

## Paper Requirement Coverage

The current system covers these project/paper requirements:

```text
Playlist continuation task:
  Input observed prefix, hold out the final songs, recommend top-K continuations.

Collaborative filtering:
  Uses song-song co-occurrence from playlists.

Metadata-aware recommendation:
  Uses artist metadata, popularity, and lyrics-derived optional semantics.

Two-stage recommendation:
  Stage 1 candidate generation, Stage 2 reranking.

Evaluation:
  Reports Recall@10, NDCG@10, Proxy@10, and Stage 1 recall at multiple candidate sizes.

Ablation/comparison:
  Compares random, popularity, CF, CF+artist, and CF+artist+playlist semantic.

Controlled LLM semantic generation:
  Uses fixed schema, allowed labels, JSONL cache, and no heldout-song leakage.
```

Current limitation:

```text
The current fine-keyword semantic run improves the best proxy score slightly
when used with a low weight. The signal is still weak because song-side profiles
are heuristic rather than LLM-generated or embedding-based.
```

## LLM Prompts

### Active playlist-semantic prompt in `recommandation.py`

This is the prompt structure used by the current recommender:

```text
Classify this playlist for music recommendation.
Use only the observed songs below. Do not infer from hidden future songs.
Return valid JSON only. No markdown. No explanation.
Use only labels from the allowed lists. Do not invent new labels.
top_keywords must be exactly 3 labels describing the playlist's musical intent, not artist identity.
affect, genre_style, and narrative_theme must be arrays with 1 to 3 labels.
All other fields must be one label string.

Every key is required. Never return empty strings or empty arrays.
If uncertain, use mixed. For energy use mid. For next_song_role use same_vibe.

Allowed labels:
- top_keywords: high_arousal, low_arousal, dancefloor, theatrical, rebellious, melancholic_story, nostalgic, cinematic, angsty, romantic_tension, party, workout, roadtrip, chill, singalong, dark, uplifting, confident, dreamy, aggressive, playful, anime, club, acoustic, heartbreak, empowerment, mixed
- affect: confident, dramatic, melancholic, angsty, euphoric, dark, playful, dreamy, aggressive, nostalgic, romantic, chill, uplifting, mixed
- genre_style: rock, alt_rock, classic_rock, pop, dance_pop, hiphop, rnb, country, soul, folk, metal, electronic, electropop, punk, indie, soundtrack, anime, mixed
- narrative_theme: love, heartbreak, desire, self_expression, youth, escape, loneliness, resilience, celebration, conflict, fantasy, coming_of_age, depression, empowerment, mixed
- listening_context: party, wedding, halloween, workout, roadtrip, chill, slow_dance, nostalgia, singalong, background, mixed
- energy: low, mid, high
- valence: negative, mixed, positive
- cohesion: genre, affect, activity, theme, story, mixed
- next_song_role: same_vibe, energy_lift, cooldown, genre_bridge, singalong, romantic, spooky

Required JSON schema:
{"top_keywords":[],"affect":[],"energy":"","valence":"","genre_style":[],"narrative_theme":[],"listening_context":"","cohesion":"","next_song_role":""}

playlist_id: {playlist_id}
observed_song_count: {len(observed)}
observed songs, in playlist order, with short lyric excerpts:
- title: {title}; artist: {artist}; lyrics_excerpt: {lyrics_excerpt}

JSON:
```

The current fine-keyword semantic runs used:

```text
semantic_recent_songs = 8
semantic_lyrics_chars = 100
semantic_max_new_tokens = 130
model = Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
```

### Song-level LLM prompt

The current recommender does not use a song-level LLM semantic file. Song-side
semantic profiles are currently heuristic profiles built from title, artist, and
lyrics. The LLM only creates playlist-side JSON profiles from the observed songs.

The old/smoke-test song-style prompt idea was:

```text
Convert this song into a controlled semantic profile for a music recommendation experiment.
Return only one JSON object. Do not output numeric scores.
Schema keys: dominant_emotion, secondary_emotion, valence, arousal, theme_tags, emotion_arc, playlist_role.
Allowed emotions: love, sadness, energy, calm, hope, anger, nostalgia, neutral.
Allowed valence: negative, mixed, positive. Allowed arousal: low, medium, high.
Lyrics: {lyrics}
JSON:
```

That song-level prompt is not part of the active algorithm because previous
emotion-only semantics were not reliable enough and the active experiment moved
to playlist-side semantics.
